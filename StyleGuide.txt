NOTE: I've currently filled this with my own style as a template. This means that it is subject to change as we see fit.

Curly Braces:
	-Open and close on their own, separate lines
	-Control blocks must include curly brackets
	-If the items inside of a control block only contain a couple statements, the entire thing can be written on a single line. Discression must be used when determining when to use this. The purpose is to group slightly longer bits of code into a compact block for ease of reading, also when the calculation is used once and therefore doesn't deserve a function.
	Good Example:
		if (condition)
		{
			foo()
		}
		
		if (i) { foo(); }
		
	Bad Example:
		if (condition) {
			foo();
		}
	
		if (condition)
			foo()
		
		if (condition) { if (condition2) { stuff(); stuff2(); if (condition2) { stuff3(); } } 
	
Pointers:
	-the '*' is always located attatched to the variable.
	Good Example:
		int *a = 0;
		*a = new int(3);
		*a = *a + 3
		int *b, *c, *d;
	Bad Example:
		int * a;
		int* b;
		int* c, * d, * e;
		
Variable, Class, Function Names:
	-Local Variables
		-camel case
	-Global Variables
		-Capitalized
	-Class Member Variables
		-Capitalized
	-Function Names

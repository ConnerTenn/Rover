NOTE: I've currently filled this with my own style as a template. This means that it is subject to change as we see fit.

Curly Braces:
	Open and close on their own, separate lines
	
	Control blocks must include curly brackets
	Example:
		//Good
		if (1)
		{
			foo()
		}
		
		//Bad
		if (1)
			foo()
